- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ShashankDongre
- Currently, I am a Northeastern University graduate student studying Information Systems. The graduate program brought out the best in me by enabling me to work on projects. These project experiences helped me to explore and dive deeper into concepts like database architecture, data modeling, and data integrity. It helped me develop my thinking in crucial business-critical aspects like indexing, partitioning, and query optimization. The hands-on exposure to several cloud computing services on Azure (Data Factory, Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Synapse, and Azure Machine Learning) is solidifying my interest in the field and opening doors for further learning and growth.

- Having a unique blend of business and technical background, I am aiming to find myself in a position where I can extract value and insights from huge data sets and leverage machine learning and large language models (LLMs) to aid decision-making and drive business.
